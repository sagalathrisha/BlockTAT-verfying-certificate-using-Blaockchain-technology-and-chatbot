<h2> Project Information </h2>
As cyber threats continue to evolve, malware has emerged as a widespread and highly sophisticated menace across the Internet. Traditional signature-based antivirus scanners struggle to keep pace with the rapidly increasing diversity of malware, leaving millions of hosts vulnerable to attacks.

This project aims to overcome the shortcomings of conventional detection techniques by harnessing the power of machine learning for enhanced malware detection. It adopts an anomaly-driven strategy for identifying malware, highlighting the pivotal role of machine learning in recognizing and neutralizing these security risks. Through extensive research and analysis, the project sheds light on the shortcomings of signature-based methods and the growing challenges posed by polymorphic and previously unseen malware variants.

The primary goal is to create a robust malware detection system through the application of machine learning techniques. Machine learning, leveraging algorithms such as Random Forest and Logistic Regression, offers a promising avenue for malware detection by training algorithms to detect patterns indicative of malicious behavior. Unlike traditional methods, which rely on known malware samples, machine learning models can identify previously unseen threats and polymorphic malware variants. By utilizing advanced algorithms, this approach aims to enhance detection accuracy while mitigating false positives and negatives, thereby bolstering cybersecurity defenses in the face of evolving cyber threats.
